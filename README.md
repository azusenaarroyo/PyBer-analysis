# PyBer-analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis will provide an overview of PyBer, a ride-sharing company's, total weekly fares by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) from January 2019 to April 2019. In addition, we will explore the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver for each city type. 

## Results
The Rural city type has the highest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. In contrast, the Urban city type had the lowest. The Urban city type has the highest amounts of Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares, the Rural city type had the lowest. There is an inverse relationship between Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares and the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. As the cities become more urban, we can see the Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares increase. In addition, the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver decreases as the cities become more urban. This may be due to population size which directly effects the amount of requests for ride-sharing services and the availability of drivers.

In the Total Fare by City multiple line chart there is sharp increase in all three city types the last week of February. Then, there is a decrease in all city types in the beginning of March.

## Summary
I would recommend the CEO to investigate the following: 
* There was a dip in the amount of fares for all three city types in the beginning of March. What contributed to this significant dip?
* There was a sharp increase in the amount of fares in the last week of February. What contributed to this increase and how can we maximize this opportunity?
* The Suburban city type had an upward trend in April while the other two city types had a downward trend. What contributed the upward and downward trends?
